# Project Description

This project is a TO-DO list application, which gives the user the opportunity to create tasks, add them to and store them in a database, mark them as complete (or back to incomplete if needed), or remove the task entirely.

In order to create this application, I mapped out how the functionality would work, and then began to code according to the map that I created.  I would start with server request, test them in Postman, and once I could prove the requests would work, I would then move to the client side for the corresponding functionality.

Overall, this was a good project for me to better my understanding of the full stack, improve my comfort level with testing ("Postman"), and get more confident with Bootstrap styling.
