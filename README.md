# TO-DO App

## Description
For this weekend project (#3), we were given the task of creating a TO-DO list application, which gives the user the opportunity to create tasks (which will add them and store them to a local database), mark them as complete (or back to incomplete if needed), or remove the task entirely (delete from the database).
